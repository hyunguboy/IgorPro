The EPA figures can be useful for visualizing air quality over time, and so I wrote this procedure so that I could make similar figures in Igor Pro 8 using other data sources. In this case, I wanted to use data from AirKorea, which is a service that monitors air quality across South Korea.

Unfortunately, AirKorea's data format is inconsistent over time, and sometimes data points are just missing, so be wary.
